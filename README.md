## Glossary Words:
### 1. Branch
In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
### 2. Clone
A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.
### 3. Commit
Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
### 4. Fetch
Fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.
### 5. GIT
Git is a popular version control system.
### 6. Github
GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.
### 7. Merge
Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.
### 8. Merge Conflict
Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub.
### 9. Push
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
### 10. Pull
Git pull updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote tracking branches.
### 11. Remote
A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.
### 12. Repository
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
